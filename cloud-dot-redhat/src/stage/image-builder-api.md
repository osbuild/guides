# Using Image Builder in staging environment from command line

Note: The staging environment requires access to the Red Hat VPN, so is only accessible to Red Hat employees. This is the first step in our deployment and the production environment will be available to select outside users soon!

Image Builder is an instance of an upstream image-builder project. You can find the code and report issues here: [https://github.com/osbuild/image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/image-builder) . It provides a REST API, which is accessible using the squid.corp.redhat.com HTTP proxy server.

All you need to access the service is the “curl” tool which is available on any operating system and a user account in the staging environment.

## Create account in stage environment

Start here:[http://account-manager-stage.app.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/#create](http://account-manager-stage.app.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/#create)

and:
 * Fill in a username which is **not** your kerberos name, for example `image-builder-<nickname>`.
 * Create a new password which is **not** your kerberos password.
 * Assign yourself these SKUs (something like a subscription): `MCT3475, MCT3718, RH0105260, RH00003`
 * Check that you are creating the account in "Stage" environment
 * Click "Create"

Now using your new account name and password, you can display the available API endpoints like this:
```
curl --user "username:password" \
        --proxy http://squid.corp.redhat.com:3128 \
        https://cloud.stage.redhat.com/api/image-builder/v1/openapi.json
```

The command contains:
 * Your credentials after the `--user` CLI flag
 * URL of the HTTP proxy server after the `--proxy` flag
 * URL of the staging instance of image builder

*Tip: If you want nice formatting of the JSON object, use the “jq” tool):*
```
curl --user "username:password" \
        --proxy http://squid.corp.redhat.com:3128 \
        https://cloud.stage.redhat.com/api/image-builder/v1/openapi.json | jq .
```

## Creating and monitoring a compose

There are two main API endpoints related to starting and monitoring a compose:
 1. HTTP POST /v1/compose
 2. HTTP GET /v1/composes/<uuid>

If you want to start a new compose, you need to create a JSON file containing a description of the image you want. For example:
```json
{
  "distribution": "rhel-8",
  "image_requests": [
    {
      "architecture": "x86_64",
      "image_type": "ami",
      "upload_requests": [
        {
          "type": "aws",
          "options": {
            "share_with_accounts": [
              "your-aws-account-id"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Save the file as “image-builder-request.json”.

Given the JSON file above, Image Builder will create a RHEL 8 AMI image for x86\_64 architecture and upload it to AWS EC2. It will then share the AMI with the specified account.

Now trigger a new compose:
```
curl --user "username:password" \
        --proxy http://squid.corp.redhat.com:3128 \
        -d "@image-builder-request.json" -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://cloud.stage.redhat.com/api/image-builder/v1/compose
{"id":"cb13b6e6-d24e-4417-a4f4-547f410609e1"}
```

The command specifies:
 * JSON body of the message (-d)
 * HTTP POST method (-X)
 * HTTP header “Content-Type” (-H)
 * The output contains id of the newly created compose which you can use to monitor it:
```
curl --user "username:password" \
        --proxy http://squid.corp.redhat.com:3128 \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://cloud.stage.redhat.com/api/image-builder/v1/composes/cb13b6e6-d24e-4417-a4f4-547f410609e1
{"status":"running"}
```

Once the status is “success”, you can go to your AWS account and check the list of available AMIs. The AMI will appear in `us-east-1`.

*(TODO: we need a way to identify the AMI and region)*
