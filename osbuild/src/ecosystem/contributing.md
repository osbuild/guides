# Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to any of the projects in the osbuild
ecosystem you are more than welcome to do so! We're always happy for people
to test, document, give feedback, or even write code and we're happy to help
you get on your way.

You can find us on [GitHub](https://github.com/osbuild) or on the *#osbuild*
channel on the [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC network.

## Getting Started

To get the projects running for a development environment you can read the
installation instructions of the project you want to hack on.

If you don't have anything in mind yet of what you'd like to do then we do
try to tag issues on GitHub with `good-first-issue` so take a look through
those:

* [osbuild good first issues](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* [osbuild-composer good first issues](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
