# Introduction

Welcome to the `osbuild` project guides. These project guides are meant to help
users and developers of the `osbuild` projects to find their bearings.

## What is `osbuild`?

`osbuild` is a project to create operating system images of Linux operating
systems in a reliable fashion, isolating image creation from your host
operating system and producing a reliable and well-defined image ready to be
deployed where it is needed.

## A project or a program?

Both. `osbuild` itself is a project that contains separate programs to fulfill
all tasks related to building operating system images. The separate programs
and their tasks are described in depth in the [Ecosystem](/ecosystem/index.md)
chapter of the guides.
