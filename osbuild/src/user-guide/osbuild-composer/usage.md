## Command Line

### `composer-cli`

`osbuild-composer` comes with a default command line interface to interact with
it. The command is called `composer-cli` and is provided by the `composer-cli`
package. Historically this tool was called `weldr-client`, you can find its usage
in the [relevant chapter there](/user-guide/weldr-client/usage.md).
