# User/Administrator/Contributor Guides for OSBuild and osbuild-composer

Intended audience:
 1. User guide - if you were to use osbuild-composer for the first time, this is what you should read.
 2. Administrator guide - TBD.
 3. Contributor - highlevel overview of osbuild-composer and osbuild, not replicating information that can be found in HACKING.md in osbuild and composer repositories.
