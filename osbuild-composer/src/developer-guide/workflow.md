# Workflow

## Adding news

When adding a new feature to a project which should be included in the release notes, or used for
announcements, please add it under `docs/news` in the form of a short markdown document.

Bug fixes, test changes, etc... should not be announced there.

## Git Workflow

### Commits

Commits should be easy to read.

The commit message should explain clearly what it's trying to do and why. The following format is
common but not required:

```
<module>: Topic of the commit

Body of the commit, describing the changes in more detail.
```

The `<module>` should point to the area of the codebase (for instance `tests` or `tools`). The topic
should summarize what the commit is doing.

GitHub truncates the first line if it's longer than 65 characters, which is something to keep in
mind as well.

A `Fixes #issue-number` can be added to automatically link and close a related issue if it exists.

### Pull requests

A pull request should be one or more commits which form a coherent unit, it can be
rebased/rewritten/force-pushed until it's fit for merging.

Pull requests are usually opened against the main branch. They should be opened from a developer's
own fork to avoid a lot of random branches on the origin.

Each pull request should be reviewed, and the CI should pass.

A pull request can be marked as draft, if it shouldn't be reviewed yet. But once it's ready, do not
hesitate to add reviewers. If you're unsure who to add as a reviewer, ask in the irc channel
(#osbuild on Libera Chat).

Once a pull request is ready to be merged, it should be merged via the `Rebase and merge` or `Squash
and merge` option. This avoids merge commits on the main branch.

### Branches

Force-pushing to, or rebasing the main branch (or other release branches) is not allowed. Avoid
directly pushing (fast-forward) to those branches as well. Commits can always be reverted by opening
a new pull request.
